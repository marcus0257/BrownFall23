# Portfolio Check 1 Ideas

Remember you'll be graded against the [rubric] and the [achievement checklists], but these are ideas for the structure.

You can mix and match different formats to cover the skills collectively.  

If your goal is, for example, a B+ (you need 5 level 3s) you could only do 1-2 skills per portfolio check (there are 4 checks).


## Earning Level 3s

You could also submit a few shorter pieces that in total cover
all of the skills. Some example formats:

### Tutorial
Write a notebook that explains a concept related to a skill with examples in a real dataset and with visuals or a toy dataset (minimal number of columns rows)

### Cheatsheet

Make a detailed reference with code outputs on a topic or a few topics.


### Blog post

Write a blog post styled Notebook that compares or analyzes something, for example:
- how do different ways of loading data compare
- describe best practices you've learned and show why they're good with examples

### Extension

If there were parts of your previous assignments that you thought were interesting and you want to work with those data more, you can. You need to do *more complex* analyses of them, but you can build off of what you already have done, especially for assignments 2, 3, and 5. 



### Correction & Reflection

If you had trouble with an assignment so far, you can revise what you submitted and resubmit it, with reflections and explanation of what you were confused about, what you tried initially, how you eventually figured it out, and explains the correct answer. Then go a little deeper in exploring the topic in that context to also earn level 3.

### Practice Problems and Solutions

Based on the level 3 rubric descriptions, write practice problems that build off of the lecture notes. Include solutions and descriptions for each. These can be open ended or multiple choice questions with plausible distractors.  A plausible distractor is an incorrect answer that represents a way that you think someone could misunderstand.

For example if the question is 37 + 15 = ?, MCQ with plausible distractors might be:
- 52 (correct)
- 412 (didn't carry the one, correctly: 7+5 = 12, 3+1 = 4)
- 42 (dropped the one 7+5 = 12, ones place is 2, 3+1 = 4)
- 43 (carried one into wrong column, 7 + 5 = 12, 1+2 = 3, 3+1 = 3)



## Long single analysis

Collect data from multiple sources, prepare each for analysis, and merge them together then do some exploratory data analysis. Describe each step, interpret all outputs, and put the analysis in context of the Data Science Process.

This would be one long notebook that covers all of the skills.

Be sure to check the checklists for how level 3s are more complex than level 2s.  I recommend using office hours to help get ideas if you are not sure how to extend your analysis.
